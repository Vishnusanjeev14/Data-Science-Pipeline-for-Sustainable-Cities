# Data-Science-Pipeline-for-Sustainable-Cities
A data science pipeline that converts IoT sensor data into SDG-11 indicators with causal analysis, forecasting, anomaly detection, and a Streamlit dashboard.


A data science pipeline that converts IoT sensor data into Sustainable Development Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) indicators. The project integrates real air quality data from OpenAQ with traffic datasets, applies causal inference, forecasting, and anomaly detection, and visualizes results in an interactive Streamlit dashboard for policymakers and researchers.

Features

 1.Data ingestion from OpenAQ API (PM2.5 air quality) + traffic datasets

 2.Data cleaning & processing into monthly SDG-11 indicators

 3.Causal analysis (Difference-in-Differences) to evaluate IoT interventions

 4.Forecasting (ARIMA/Prophet/LSTM) to predict future sustainability trends

 5.Anomaly detection (Isolation Forest) for pollution spikes or faulty sensors
 
 6.Interactive Streamlit dashboard for exploring results
