# Data-Science-Pipeline-for-Sustainable-Cities
A data science pipeline that converts IoT sensor data into SDG-11 indicators with causal analysis, forecasting, anomaly detection, and a Streamlit dashboard.


A data science pipeline that converts IoT sensor data into Sustainable Development Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) indicators. The project integrates real air quality data from OpenAQ with traffic datasets, applies causal inference, forecasting, and anomaly detection, and visualizes results in an interactive Streamlit dashboard for policymakers and researchers.

Features

 Data ingestion from OpenAQ API (PM2.5 air quality) + traffic datasets

 Data cleaning & processing into monthly SDG-11 indicators

 Causal analysis (Difference-in-Differences) to evaluate IoT interventions

 Forecasting (ARIMA/Prophet/LSTM) to predict future sustainability trends

 Anomaly detection (Isolation Forest) for pollution spikes or faulty sensors
 
 Interactive Streamlit dashboard for exploring results
